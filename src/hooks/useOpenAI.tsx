The Secret Histories and Magical World of Superia Echo of the Ancients In an era when elemental spirits and humans coexisted harmoniously, these spirits bestowed blessings that ensured prosperity and longevity. Those with pure hearts were capable of communing with the spirit realm and became known as Conduits. They sought only modest favors at first. Spirit-infused tools, perfectly suited to the task of making an honest day’s work a bit easier, were given to humanity. As the Conduits were reasonable in what they asked for, so too did the balance between the spirit and human realms endure…until humanity's reliance on these blessings grew too heavy and their desires too bold.Over time, resources once shared freely became hoarded. Goodwill slowly gave way to personal intentions. Conduits, who had strived for balance, were forced to ask for more powerful spirit-infused tools intended to exert control or even harm others. Being so pure of heart, most Conduits refused to make such requests. One by one, they were shunned and stripped of their access to the spirit realm and replaced by those who called themselves leaders. No amount of impassioned prayers or offerings of hoarded harvests allowed the leaders to commune with the spirits. Requests grew to demands and demands to threats. All manner of vitriol was cast toward the spirit realm with no Conduits there to press for patience or self-reflection. In turn, the spirits retreated to their ethereal realm, denying the leaders their base desires and rendering the once powerful tools useless. Humanity was left lost and divided between those longing for the spirits’ return and those unwilling to abandon personal gain at the expense of others. The Betrayal at the Temple of Spirits Centuries passed without the spirits, and humans developed crude energy sources that poisoned the land and hearts of all. Some still hoped for the spirits' return, while others, driven by fear and greed, formed numerous factions and violently seized control wherever the opportunity arose, all while ignoring the growing signs of impending ecological disaster. As human technologies failed and the world descended into factional chaos, all hope seemed lost. However whispers among the people spoke of a uniquely pure-hearted individual named Orin Zevran, a man who claimed to be the last Conduit. He spoke of promises to align the human and spirit realms once again. The factions reluctantly acknowledged that reconciling with the spirits might be the only way to save themselves and searched for this pure-hearted man. Upon finding Orin, the faction leaders, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, accepted his proposal and agreed to undertake a pilgrimage to the Temple of the Spirits, an all-but-forgotten place where the veil between realms was most permeable. Massive stone doors, sealed since time immemorial, opened before the unlikely visitors. Inside the temple, Orin knelt to commune with the spirits, asking for their forgiveness, and, to everyone’s astonishment, they answered with four distinct elemental orbs of light. Some of the assembled men and women, their ambition and low cunning overcoming their wisdom, struck Orin in an act of hideous betrayal and seized the elemental spirits for themselves. His betrayers already had in their thieving hands the powers of earth, wind, and fire, so in a final act of defiance, Orin called upon the grace of the last element, water. A liquid plume of azure arced over the betrayers, splitting into twelve shards and landing as artifacts in the hands of those who had not been consumed by their base impulses. Drained nigh unto death, Orin was drawn into the spirit realm and vanished from the realm of humans. A fierce battle ensued inside the temple, but the betrayers, wielding the elemental powers of earth, wind, and fire, overwhelmed Orin’s followers. Those who had remained loyal to his ideals were driven from their ancestral lands, scattered, and hunted by those who sought dominion over all. The Temple of Spirits fell into ruin, desecrated as a symbol of the betrayers’ triumph. In the wake of their victory, the betrayers wielded their newly acquired powers to impose their will upon the world, twisting the land to their design and stamping out any threat the remnants of Orin’s vision posed. The Water Spirit’s Artifacts went dormant, and the betrayers’ descendants entrenched their rule, wielding their elemental dominion to suppress any hope of resistance. Exile and the Founding of Lur The world withered under the betrayers' grip. The land, poisoned by unchecked greed, became barren and hostile. People everywhere were stripped of unity and turned on one another in desperation, but no one suffered more than Orin’s followers. In his absence, they formed the Water Clans but were hunted and lived as exiles. Wherever they went, their sacred rivers were dammed, their shrines razed to the ground, and their rituals outlawed. The betrayers were relentless. The Water Clans, broken and constantly pursued, had prepared for their last stand when the spirits showed them another path. The Spirit Artifacts, long thought inert, stirred with new life, their inscriptions revealing a single direction—west, across the endless, untamed ocean at their backs. To remain was to perish, but to leave was unthinkable. The chosen clan leaders, guided by Artifact-derived powers, gathered their people and set sail into the unknown across an unforgiving sea. After weeks with no sign of land, they reached a distant, wild, and unclaimed continent that would come to be known as Lur. Scattered across its shores and rivers, they built anew. But the loss of their homeland, the betrayal at the Temple of Spirits, and the brutal passage across the sea left scars so deep that no generation ever sought to return. Over time, the lands they had left behind faded from memory, spoken of only in fragmented, half-remembered myths that drifted away like mist upon ocean waves. Generations passed, and the exiles became the architects of a new world. What began as scattered settlements grew into cities, and with each passing age, the Water Clans adapted to a land untouched by the spirits they once served. The balance that had defined their ancestors was gone, replaced by something new—something of their own making. The World of Superia on the Edge The Age of Spirits was buried beneath centuries of progress, conflict, and reinvention. With the power of Water magic and Steam, the great capital city of Regalia rose from the earth, home to the seat of power claimed by the six clans of the Majority Faction: Arkan, Burua, Felis, Orah, Patim, and Valdark. Unified in tradition, they hold the secrets of steam power—its design, its calibration, its limits.They claim to protect the continent from the mistakes of the past, halting progress at the edge of control. No new inventions are permitted. No expansion of the existing systems allowed. They guard the steamworks as they do their water shrines and Spirit Artifacts, fearing that even a single breakthrough could unravel the fragile balance that keeps Lur at peace. Opposing this hoarding of secrets are the four clans of the Renegade Faction: Liminaris, Morrigan, Mortan, and Noctis. To them, the Majority’s grip on technological advancement is not caution—it is fear…and perhaps something more. Every attempt to cross the raging oceans that surround the continent of Lur has ended the same way: steam systems failing just offshore, every vessel stalling dead before they reach the open blue, and no survivors. The Renegade Faction suspects sabotage, engineered limitations buried deep within the technology itself, while the Majority Faction denies it. In response, they disrupt trade routes, steal and hoard rare materials, and sketch unapproved schematics of advanced airships capable of the great journey, or war. Navigating between the rising tensions are the Neutral Clans—unbound by loyalty, unmoved by doctrine. They profit from the friction, selling discretion to both sides, shifting allegiance like the tides that surround Lur. Some say they have quietly made their own technological advances in secret, but nothing can be confirmed. This is the world of Superia as it stands—the land of Lur, driven by the power of steam and shaped by the forces of ancient Water magic, twelve Clans, and countless paths forward. Welcome to the World of Superia!";
